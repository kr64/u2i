{"name":"u2i","tagline":"u2i - Arduino-based USB/serial <-> I2C, SMBus Bridge","body":"### Welcome to u2i\r\nArduino-based USB/serial to I2C/SMBus bridge. Bridges between USB/(virtual)serial and I2C/SMBus using a very simple command set. Host-side, please use a suitable terminal (e.g. [Gtkterm](https://fedorahosted.org/gtkterm/)). The commands are simple enough to be manually typed. Supported SMBus transactions are Read Byte/Word, Write Byte/Word. For writing, command grouping is fully supported. I2C transmission rates of 100kb/s and 400kb/s have been tested (other transmission speeds may also work).\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n**v0.5** 30/12/2013 Write command grouping  \r\n**v0.4** 29/12/2013 Status byte added (command z)\r\n\r\n### Commands\r\n* `a [a..]` _view/set i2c address(es)_\r\n* `f [speed]` _view/set bus frequency in kHz (kb/s)_\r\n* `h` _show help_\r\n* `r [c] [b]` _smbus read byte/word c=command b=nof_bytes_\r\n* `s [a0] [a1]` _scan i2c bus from address a0 to a1_\r\n* `v` _show version_\r\n* `w [c] [b..]` _smbus write byte(s) c=command_\r\n* `z [v]` _view/set status byte_\r\n\r\n***\r\n_Notes:_\r\n\r\n1. all values to u2i in hex w/o format specified\r\n1. smbus write commands will be grouped and sent to all set addresses\r\n1. smbus read commands issued to first set address (only)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n### Supported Arduino platforms\r\n1.
